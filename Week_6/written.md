Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) is generally more data-efficient than logistic regression under its assumption that the data follow a Gaussian distribution. However, if this Gaussian assumption breaks down in the real world, how quickly does GDA's performance degrade? Is there a critical "non-Gaussian" point beyond which logistic regression, with its fewer assumptions, becomes more robust and performs better?
